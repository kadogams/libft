# Libft

An implementation of multiple functions from the Standard C Library and some custom ones, in order to create your own library to be used during the school curriculum.

For detailed descriptions of the functions please refer to [the man pages of standard C library](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_3.html).

## Usage

You may build the library by running ```make```, and include it in your C project:

```
#include "libft.h"
```
